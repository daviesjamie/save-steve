# Save Steve

This is the code for savesteve.party, which is the online component of a series
of puzzles designed by Katie and me to entertain our friends on a zoom call.

Each puzzle results in a 3-digit code, which the players have to enter into the
boxes on savesteve.party to work their way through the puzzles, until they
reach a screen telling them that they've got to the end (i.e. "won").

Steve is a cat, and the theme of this series of puzzles is that a dog has
kidnapped him - hence the "save Steve" name.

No cats were harmed in the creation of these puzzles.
